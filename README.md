# Insurance Charges Prediction using Linear Regression

This project explores how demographic and lifestyle factors (like age, BMI, smoking habits, and region)
affect medical insurance charges using linear regression.

### 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains information about insurance customers:
- **age** – age of primary beneficiary  
- **sex** – gender (male/female)  
- **bmi** – body mass index  
- **children** – number of dependents  
- **smoker** – whether the person smokes or not  
- **region** – residential area in the US  
- **charges** – individual medical costs billed by health insurance  

### 🧠 Key Steps
1. Data cleaning and feature conversion  
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Log-transformation for skewed target variable  
4. Model training and evaluation (RMSE, R²)  
5. Visualization of predicted vs actual charges  

### 💡 Insights
- **Smoker status** and **BMI** were the strongest predictors of insurance charges.  
- The **log-transformed model** performed better than the original scale model.  
- R² improved, indicating that log-transformation helps handle skewed cost data.  

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Language: R  
- Libraries: None (base R only)  
- Visuals: Plots saved as PNGs
